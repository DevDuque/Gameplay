I made the SignIN page with react, using buttons as components, and modals with styles, using a global styles for make easier to see the colors useds in whole app

gameplay, we gonna use the discord API for make the groups and the backend easily.



when people get nervous we see a lot of pacifying gestures, as moving their legs, manipulating their hands/feet for being more
calm and less anxious.

we tend to get closer to people we like so is a good thing, good confidence gestures is a good way to show your goods
characterists but not for long, human can be fragile, don't be so ashamed of being sad or anxious, is normal everyone
needs a help sometimes.

I learned that people can be hard to keep the things together but i know that we have the power for being the example
the good leader, whatever it takes :D
